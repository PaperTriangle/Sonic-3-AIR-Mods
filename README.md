# Sonic-3-AIR-Mods
A collection of PaperTriangle's Sonic 3 A.I.R. Mods both in progress and released.

## Battery Powered Intro
Simple mod that adds in two intro styles for FBZ! I Would honestly not recommend using it as there are better options.

## Fire Breath on the Edge
It always kind of bugged me that Fire Breath has a space behind it in AIZ1. This mod moves the boss closer to the edge to remove the safe space. Also includes a setting for if you want the cut-scene positioning to be closer to the edge, since I like it not being right on the edge during the cutscene.

## Where's Robo
Simple rawdata mod to replace the object layout of SSZ so the first Eggrobo badnik jetpacks in a little earlier to actually show up in the stage at the wider resolution of Sonic 3 AIR.

Will not work with another mod that replaces SSZ layouts.

## Sweep Up That Dust
Removes the dust from the Spindash while the character is in the air and starts it again once they hit the ground. Also has an option for some more detailed spindash dust sprites. *(This mod also fixes a display issue with dust from **Drop Dash +** after it goes off screen...)*

## Stop Dropping My Dash
A small mod that allows Sonic to hold a Drop Dash while bouncing off of more objects

## Don't Stop My Glide
A small mod that allows Knuckles to stay in a glide while breaking Rocks / Walls.

## Imma Let You Finish
Forces the characters to stop fidgeting and let the act end.

## Better Snow
I like how the clouds in SSZ are transparent, and it bugs me that the snow that falls during the ICZ bosses flickers.

## Hydrocity Shake
Makes characters use their balance animation in the HCZ â†’ MGZ stage transition, similar to Origins.

Simple mod because I couldn't find anything else that did this...

## Extra Knuckles Frames
Adds in a couple of extra frames to Knuckles from Origins. Also removes custom LBZ2 falling animation for Knuckles.

## MGZ Eggman on the Edge
Simple mod that moves the MGZ Eggman boss closer to the screen edge because I was asked for it.

Should work fine with other resolutions.

## HCZ Wobbly Spheres Near Boss Fix
Fixes the animation lock when near the act 1 boss on the wobble spheres in the HCZ tiles.

## Data Select Options
A mod that adds some options to the data select like adding semi-transparent shadows, removing the emerald glint and shifting everything to the left a bit for less wasted screen space.

Also has an option to remove the lives and continues detail, shifting the player icons down. This has some hacky Extra Slot support that might not work for all characters...

## Break That Pipe!
Allow the LBZ pipes to break like standard rocks! Has compatibility with **Don't Stop My Glide**.

Now the Fire Shield's dash, regular ol' Knuckles and Super Sonic can break them with ease!

## Better Big Arm Fade
This mod makes the fade effect of the background at the start of the Big Arm fight use the Sonic 3 A.I.R. methods to blend the background colours.

So more blending steps can easily be added for a smoother transition. Originally it was every 16 frames. This mod makes it every 8 frames by default, but also allows you to customise it to 4, 2, or every frame!

In addition to this, the fade will take the palette from whatever is initially set! So, simple palette mods that change the sky like **Launch Base Zone blue sky** or **LBZ Relaxed Blue Sky + Better Death Egg** will also work with this mod. However more complicated mods that alter this transition likely will not be compatible.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you use **Ambient Mod** for the rain in the Big Arm fight, please place it above this mod or the rain will not end correctly!

## Alternate LBZ2 Cutscene
Converts the LBZ2 Ending scene after beating Big Arm to me a bit more like Origins. The platform catches fire and detaches, then the stage clear happens as the platform falls and finally the sky transitions as the Death Egg falls.

I know this is not _exactly_ like Origins, but I do not mind and kind of like it more. That said, this mod also includes an option for the stage fanfare and to give the final arena the Origins-esc floating off the edge... Or you can disable the widescreen safety and fight Big Arm like a true blue hedgehog!

There is a compatibility with **LBZ Eggman Fleeing**, **Origins Parity Galore** and **Better Big Arm Fade**! You will need to load this mod over them.

## Time Consistent Adventure
This mod adjusts the palettes and some stage art for many zones to provide a more consistent passage of time with the Sonic & Tails and the Knuckles adventures.

There are a few configurations options, however it is mostly intended that you would run this for all possible zones.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is intended to be played alongside a mod that restores the original zone order, and stops Knuckles from visiting FBZ. Probably will not work right with other palette mods or any mods that alter the FBZ, SOZ, HPZ or SSZ backgrounds / tiles.

## Paper's HUD Additions
Adds a new Sonic CD inspired life icon and a Transform button. Should work with regular and mobile views with compatibility with **Haru's Forever-esque HUD**, **Extra Sloy Mighty, Ray & Amy** and **Extra Slot 3D in 2D Shadow**. The transform button has compatibility with **Characters Go Super Then Hyper** and possibly **Super Post-Trade**.

## Gotta Go Fast!
A mod that adds in a Fast Dash to Sonic and Knuckles, providing configurations to make the way the Fast Run works configurable and consistent. Can also override some ESU characters for consistency. *(Please note that I do not recall where the sprites came from and need to investigate / replace them.)*

## Flying Hold Frame Fix
Makes the animation while holding on to tails less jumpy. Should be placed below other sprite mods. Should work with ESU if placed below it.

## HCZ & ICZ Alternate Title Cards
Simple mod to put a space in "HYDROCITY" and "ICECAP" title cards, making them "HYDRO CITY" and "ICE CAP", respectively.

Requires Veenee's **Title Card Elements and Results Screen Sprites* mod to work. Also comes with a version in the style of Trimint123's **Zone Japanese Text** mod.
