# Sonic-3-AIR-Mods
A collection of PaperTriangle's Sonic 3 A.I.R. Mods both in progress and released.

## PaperLib
Not a mod as such, but just a place for me to store useful functions I create.

## Battery Powered Intro
Simple mod that adds in two intro styles for FBZ! I Would honestly not recommend using it as there are better options.

## Eggman Go Left
Simple mod to make Eggman flee left at the end of CNZ2. This is intended for people who use a mod to restore the OG zone order so it make more logical sense that Eggman flees in the direction of his Flying Battery.

## Fire Breath on the Edge
It always kind of bugged me that Fire Breath has a space behind it in AIZ1.

This was adjusted in Origins, and looking through the AIR Scripts there was a commented out line from what looked like an attempt to fix this.

So I decided to try and implement this myself! I have added a setting for if you want the cut-scene positioning to change. (I liked it where it was tbh...)

This should also work if you run the game at other resolutions with a mod like the **Classic Mode Sample Mod** or **Screen Resolution+**. However, I did not test every resolution case.

## Where's Robo
Simple rawdata mod to replace the object layout of SSZ so the first Eggrobo badnik jetpacks in a little earlier to actually show up in the stage at the wider resolution of Sonic 3 AIR.

Will not work with another mod that replaces SSZ layouts.

## Knuckles Runs in Doomsday
Simple mod to revert Knuckles to his running animation on Doomsday Zone instead of gliding. Why? To allow mods that add their own super knuckles running animation to shine.

## Sweep Up that Drop Dash + Dust
Simple mod to load above **Drop Dash +** to remove the dush when it goes offscreen.

## Better Snow
I like how the clouds in SSZ are transparent, and it bugs me that the snow that falls during the ICZ bosses flickers.

## Hydrocity Shake
Makes characters use their balance animation in the HCZ â†’ MGZ stage transition, similar to Origins.

Simple mod because I couldn't find anything else that did this...

## Extra Knuckles Frames
Adds in a couple of extra frames to Knuckles from Origins. Also removes custom LBZ2

## MGZ Eggman on the Edge
Simple mod that moves the MGZ Eggman boss closer to the screen edge because I was asked for it.

Should work fine with other resolutions.

## Left Shifted Data Select 
Simple and quick mod that left shifts the default AIR data select window for less wasted screen space.

I have not tested this much so there _might_ be some issues.

## Break That Pipe!
Allow the LBZ pipes to break like standard rocks!

Now the Fire Shield's dash, regular ol' Knuckles and Super Sonic can break them with ease!

## Better Big Arm Fade
This mod makes the fade effect of the background at the start of the Big Arm fight use the Sonic 3 A.I.R. methods to blend the background colours.

So more blending steps can easily be added for a smoother transition. Originally it was every 16 frames. This mod makes it every 8 frames by default, but also allows you to customise it to 4, 2, or every frame!

In addition to this, the fade will take the palette from whatever is initially set! So, simple palette mods that change the sky like **Launch Base Zone blue sky** or **LBZ Relaxed Blue Sky + Better Death Egg** will also work with this mod. However more complicated mods that alter this transition likely will not be compatible.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you use **Ambient Mod** for the rain in the Big Arm fight, please place it above this mod or the rain will not end correctly!

## Alternate LBZ2 Cutscene
Converts the LBZ2 Ending scene after beating Big Arm to me a bit more like Origins. The platform catches fire and detaches, then the stage clear happens as the platform falls and finally the sky transitions as the Death Egg falls.

I know this is not _exactly_ like Origins, but I do not mind and kind of like it more. That said, this mod also includes an option for the stage fanfare and to give the final arena the Origins-esc floating off the edge... Or you can disable the widescreen safety and fight Big Arm like a true blue hedgehog!

There is a compatibility with **LBZ Eggman Fleeing** and **Origins Parity Galore**! You will need to load this mod over the other two.

## Flying Hold Frame Fix
Makes the animation while holding on to tails less jumpy. Requires another mod to be replacing the character sprites, though. Should work with ESU if placed below it.
